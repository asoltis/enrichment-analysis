README file for stattests.py code.

Tests included:
    1) Fisher's exact test (left-tail, right-tail, two-tail)
    2) Hypergeometric test (left-tail, right-tail, two-tail)

NOTE: Two methods are included for computing the two-tail Fisher/Hypergeometric tests:
1) 'double' (default): This method simply doubles the one-tail value. Quicker and simpler. 
2) 'smallP': This is the method of summing all probabilities <= the actual p of the input table. 
   This method requires more computation and is slower. 

# Sample execution
import stattests

# Fisher exact test
pvs = stattests.fishers_exact_test(12,5,29,2,TTmethod='smallP') # Using small p method

# Hypergeometric test
pvs = stattests.hypgeo_test(695,14000,2830,2724)

Created C version of code with cython.
- Ran python setup.py build_ext --inplace, using stattests.pyx
- Removed previous stattests.pyc from old imports

Included Benjamini-Hochberge FDR function for correcting an array of p-values. Implementation returns corrected p-value array
in same sort order as original input array.
